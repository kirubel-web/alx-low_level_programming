## Getting Started

To begin using the unique static libraries in this repository, follow the steps outlined in the [Installation](#installation) section. Once the libraries are installed, you can include them in your C projects and leverage the provided features to make your projects stand out.

## Prerequisites

To utilize these static libraries, you need the following prerequisites:

- A C compiler (e.g., gcc)
- Git (for cloning the repository)

## Installation

To install and employ the static libraries, follow these steps:

1. Clone this repository to your local machine using the following command:

   ``````bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/c-unique-static-libraries.git
   ```

   Replace `your-username` with your GitHub username.

2. Navigate to the cloned repository:

   ````bash
   cd c-unique-static-libraries
   ```

3. Build the static libraries by running the provided build script:

   ````bash
   ./build.sh
   ```

   This script will compile the source code and generate the static library files.

4. Once the build process is complete, you will find the compiled static libraries (`.a` files) in the `lib` directory.

5. To incorporate the libraries into your C projects, you must include the library files and header files in your build process. You can achieve this by adding the appropriate flags to your compiler command.

   For example, to compile a C file named `example.c` that utilizes one of the static libraries, use the following command:

   ````bash
   gcc example.c -o example -L./lib -lmylibrary -I./include
   ```

   - `-L./lib` specifies the directory where the library files are located.
   - `-lmylibrary` specifies the name of the library you wish to link (replace `mylibrary` with the actual library name).
   - `-I./include` specifies the directory where the library's header files are located.

6. You can now execute your compiled program that utilizes the static library:

   ````bash
   ./example
   ```

   Ensure that you adjust the compilation and linking flags based on your specific project and library requirements.

## Usage

Each static library in this repository offers a unique range of functionality. To comprehend how to employ a specific library, consult the documentation or readme file provided within the library's directory.

To include a library in your C project, follow these general steps:

1. Incorporate the library's header file(s) in your source code:

   ````c
   #include <library_name/library_header.h>
   ```

   Replace `library_name` with the name of the library and `library_header.h` with the appropriate header file.

2. Link the library during the compilation process, as described in the [Installation](#installation) section.

3. Utilize the functions, types, or other provided features from the library in your code to unlock its unique capabilities.

For further guidance on utilizing a specific library, consult its dedicated documentation or readme file.
